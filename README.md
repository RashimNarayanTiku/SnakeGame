# SnakeGame
Snake Game made in PyGame

This is a bare minimum game and doesn't have any special features
1. The snake eats apples and grows longer
2. The more the apples, the higher the score
3. Touching boundaries or yourself ends the game

I will hopefully add background image and soundtrack, but I can't guarantee anything.
